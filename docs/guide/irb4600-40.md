#### Irb4600-40 Field Summary

- `handSlot`: Extends the arm hand with new nodes.

### "ikpy"

`ikpy` is an inverse kinematics library written in Python.
It can be installed easily using `pip`.
For further details, please refer to [their documentation](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy).

### Samples

You will find the following sample in this folder: "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/abb/irb/worlds".

#### inverse\_kinematics.wbt

![inverse_kinematics.wbt.png](images/robots/irb4600-40/inverse_kinematics.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) This example demonstrates the use of the `ikpy` Python module.
The `ikpy` chain is hard-coded in the controller.
The arm hand is equipped with a Pen device.
During the first seconds, the robot draws a circle on a paper sheet.
Then the robot hand moves to the target yellow and black object.
If this object is moved, the robot position is updated.
