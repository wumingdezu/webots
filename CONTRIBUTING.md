## Development Guideline

* Follow our [Coding Style](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Coding-Style/).
* Avoid comitting files that exist elsewhere. Instead we should link to the source of these files.
* Avoid comitting files that can be re-created from other files using a Makefile, a script or a compiler.
